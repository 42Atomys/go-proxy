Simple go application that allows you to share your code with a custom domain name instead of github or gitlab links or other git protocols.

Say goodbye to `github.com/42Atomys/go-proxy` imports. Say hello to `atomys.codes/go-proxy` imports ðŸŽ‰

## Motivation

At the beginning to clarify my code especially with gitlab and subfolders (ex: `gitlab.com/subgroup-a/subgroup-b/subgroup-n/project`) importing files was not sexy. And a problem occurred when the folder architecture changed!

Error 404 in all directions, in all repositories. I created a classic `index.html` file but having to connect to a server to do vim (sorry emacs) is very annoying.

With [42Stellar](https://github.com/42Stellar) project, I told myself that I didn't want to redo everything, so I put this repo online
